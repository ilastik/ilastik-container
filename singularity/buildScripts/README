#INSTALLING SINGULARITY

If you already have singularity installed (possibly via conda), then skip to
"RUNNING THE CONTAINER"

If you don't have Singularity installed, run the installSingularity.sh
script with CWD at the same directory in which the script resides:

    $ ./installSingularity.sh

or alternatively, follow the installation procedures described here:

https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps

#RUNNING THE CONTAINER

Singularity images can be easily built from Docker images, so we'll just use
our Docker images unaltered.

With Singularity installed, run

    $ ./runIlastikInSingularity.sh

to download the docker image and spawn a shell into the ilastik container.
Singularity will automatically bind-mount your $HOME directory into your
container so you can access you .ilp projects as well as your sample data files
from within the host's HOME dir.

#UNINSTALLING SINGULARITY

If you've installed Singularity via the installSingularity.sh script, than
you can uninstall it by running

    $ ./uninstallSingularity.sh

You can use the ILASTIK_DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION env variable to choose the docker
image version to be used as a basis for the container.
